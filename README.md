# Huffman Algorithm
Group project that I ended up doing most of the work for

The idea of the python script is to be able to encode and decode a string into a series of 1's and 0's using a separate data file.
As it stands, the current python script is very unoptimized and there are bits and pieces that are hard-coded and could easily be improved upon.
I plan to come back to this at some point to polish it up, but this is where I have left it at the moment.
